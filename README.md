# flash-cards
Python implementation of a simple flashcard program. 

# Intro
This is a simple text-based flashcard program. Currently only creating sets, adding terms, and viewing cards are 
supported. However, I will be adding four types of quizzes soon: 

1. Self-graded
2. Text input
3. Multiple choice
4. Matching 

Other than quizzes, I plan to add the following features next: 
- ability to delete terms
- seeing your worst/ best terms (based on quiz scores)
- adding tags to cards, and selecting tags to study
- random term of the day
- various other features to make learning easier (TBD)
